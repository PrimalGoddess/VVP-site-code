            <h3>Guild Feature Coming Soon!</h3>
            <p>"This page will be a feature we implement later on, and is not currently a high priority." <br> - This page will be a social/club page. A player can come here to find or create a guild where they can meet other players, send their pets on quests together [essentially co-op mode for quests, main story], etc. <br> - Guilds would have their own main page that would be linked to from the name of that guild in the list of guilds from the primary guilds page. <br> - A guild’s main page would ideally have the name at top of it [under nav menu/site header as this should be the same across the site], maybe some optional tags the creator of the guild can apply to it [like roleplay, questing, hang out, etc], an area where the creator can put a short [like 2000 characters max] description of the guild, buttons just above the description box for things like a chat [basically a messenger group chat type chat], forums, quest board [site wide multi-player quests would ideally automatically post to this], and a members list to start. <br> - The creation page for a guild could be super simple: Area to input guild name [48 characters max], area to input guild description [2000 characters max], a selection of tags if possible [roleplay, questing, hang out, etc will figure these out in due time], an area to upload custom background image, area to upload “mascot” image, a “create guild” button, and a “cancel” button. <br> - A guild should cost about 5 VD [Vakarorian Dollars, which is our special/rarer currency] to create, and these funds should come out of the user’s bank [will go into more detail on this in the den page section], not pocket [default storage spot for on site currency]. <br> - A guild’s live chat should ideally have certain words/phrases automatically flagged/censored, so that users can not use the live chat to try and circumvent the site’s language rules. Eventually the site would also ideally have an auto translate feature for [I’d like this for the whole site] so those who don’t speak English can still speak their native tongue and those who do speak English can have the site automatically translate it for them at the click of a button. Hopefully this would help encourage activity and draw more site users. <br> - Guild feature suggestions in the suggestion forums category of our discord are welcome!</p>
